/*!
 * Wrapper around a Boost Property Tree with some basic error reporting features.
 *
 * Features. This class:
 *  * makes sure that every configuration setting in a Property Tree is read
 *    exactly once. If some settings is not read (e.g. due to a typo), a warning message
 *    is generated. The message contains a hint where it occured.
 *  * enforces a naming scheme of settings: letters a-z, numbers 0-9, underscore
 *  * provides some functionality to read lists of values using range-based for loops.
 *  * has rather long method names that are easily greppable from the source code. So a list
 *    of supported configuration options can be easily obtained from the source code.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to reduce or completely avoid the amount of error-handling
 * code in routines that take configuration parameters.
 *
 * Most methods of this class check that they have not been called before for the same
 * \c ConfigTree and the same parameter. This behaviour helps to enforce that every parameter
 * is read exactly once during parsing of the configuration settings.
 *
 * The most notable restriction of this class when compared to plain tree traversal is, that
 * one must know all the XML tags (i.e. configuration parameters) at compile time. It is not
 * possible to read from this class, which configuration parameters are present in the tree.
 * This restriction, however, is intended, because it provides the possibility to get all
 * existing configuration parameters from the source code.
 *
 * This class maintains a read counter for each parameter accessed through any of its methods.
 * Read counters are increased with every read (the only exception being the peekConfParam() method).
 * The destructor finally decreases the read counter for every tag/attribute it find on the
 * current level of the XML tree. If the increases/decreases don't cancel each other, warning
 * messages are generated. This check can also be enforced before destruction by using the
 * BaseLib::checkAndInvalidate() functions.
 *
 * The design of this class entails some limitations compared to traversing a plain tree,
 * e.g., it is not possible to obtain a list of tags or attributes from the tree,
 * but one has to explicitly query the specific tags/attributes one is interested in.
 * That way it is possible to get all used configuration parameters directly from the source
 * code where this class is used, and to maintain the quality of the configuration parameter
 * documentation.
 *
 * Instances of this class only keep a reference to the underlying <tt>boost::property_tree</tt>.
 * Therefore it is necessary that the underlying property tree stays intact as long as any
 * instance---i.e. the top level ConfigTree and any of its children---reference it.
 * In order to simplify the handling of this dependence, the class ConfigTreeTopLevel can be used.
 *
 * The construction of a ConfigTree from the content of an XML file can be done with the
 * function BaseLib::makeConfigTree(), which performs many error checks. For limitations
 * of the used XML parser, please have a look at that function's documentation.
