 *
 * The parameter \c toplevel_tag is provided for compatibility with our existing configuration

 * Unfortunately the XML parser shipped with <tt>boost::property_tree</tt> does not fully support
 * the XML standard. Additionally there might be encoding issues. From their docs:
 *
 * > Please note that RapidXML does not understand the encoding specification. If you pass it a
 * > character buffer, it assumes the data is already correctly encoded; if you pass it a filename,
 * > it will read the file using the character conversion of the locale you give it (or the global
 * > locale if you give it none). This means that, in order to parse a UTF-8-encoded XML file into
 * > a wptree, you have to supply an alternate locale, either directly or by replacing the global one.
 *
 * \see http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/doc/html/property_tree/parsers.html
