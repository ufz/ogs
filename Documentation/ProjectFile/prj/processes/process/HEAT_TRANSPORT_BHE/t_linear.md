The default setting is false. When activated, non-linear iterations will be turned off. The simulation will just go through a single iteration within a time step. If it's set to true, the **\<use_algebraic_bc\>** option must be also set to true. Only when fluid properties does not change much with temperature, this feature can be activated. The effect of skipping the non-linear iteration is much faster simulation speed.
