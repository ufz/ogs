This value is the weighting factor used to impose an algebraic boundary condition in the **HeatTransportBHE** process. The default value is 100. This value is only effective, when the option **\<use_algebraic_bc\>** is set to true. This value is multiplied with the max value of the column wise inner product and then imposed in the additional rows at the end of the linear equation system, so that the unknown temperatures at the top and bottom of the BHE are imposed with certain desired values.
