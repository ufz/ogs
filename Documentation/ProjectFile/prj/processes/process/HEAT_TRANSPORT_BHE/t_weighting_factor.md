This value is the weighting factor used to impose an algebraic boundary condition in the **HeatTransportBHE** process. If not specified, then the default value of 1000 will be applied. This value is only effective, when the option **\<use_algebraic_bc\>** is set to true. This value is imposed as positive and negative pairs of entries in the additional rows at the end of the linear equation system, so that the unknown temperatures at the top and bottom of the BHE are enforced to be the same, or being some certain desired values that satisfy a given thermal load.
