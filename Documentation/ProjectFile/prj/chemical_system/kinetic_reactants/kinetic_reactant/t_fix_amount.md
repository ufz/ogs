specify if the amount of the kinetic reactant should be fixed to the initial amount during the simulation.
Possible values: *true* (fixed); *false* (not fixed); default is *false*.
Fixing the amount of a kinetic reactant may be desirable when the kinetic reactant is used to represents a reaction rate that transfers mass between other reactants.
Note: fix_amount can only be used if a chemical_formula has been defined!
