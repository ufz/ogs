The value of the tag determines the evaluation of the constraint condition.
Possible values for the tag 'constraint_directions' are 'greater' or 'lower'.

If the value 'greater' is given the condition 'calculated_flux_value >
constraint_threshold' is evaluated. If the value 'less' is given the condition
'calculated_flux_value < constraint_threshold' is evaluated.
