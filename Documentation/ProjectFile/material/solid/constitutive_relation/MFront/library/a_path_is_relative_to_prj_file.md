This setting modifies where the shared library containing the MFront behaviour will be looked for.

The default setting of `true` should work for almost all use cases. `false` is used for some special tests in OGS's test suite.

See also the documentation of the \ref ogs_file_param__material__solid__constitutive_relation__MFront__library "<code>&lt;library&gt;</code>" tag.
