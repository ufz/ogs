Path of the shared library containing the material model.

Relative paths are interpreted relative to the project directory unless \ref ogs_file_attr__material__solid__constitutive_relation__MFront__library__path_is_relative_to_prj_file "<code>path_is_relative_to_prj_file</code>" is set to `false`, in which case the library path/name is used verbatim and will be searched based on the operating system's library lookup rules.
