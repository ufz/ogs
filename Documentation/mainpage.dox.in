/** \mainpage OpenGeoSys ${OGS_VERSION} source code documentation
 *
 * OpenGeoSys (OGS) is a scientific open source project for the development of
 * numerical methods for the simulation of thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical
 * (THMC) processes in porous and fractured media. OGS is implemented in C++, it
 * is object-oriented with an focus on the numerical solution of coupled multi-field
 * problems (multi-physics). Parallel versions of OGS are available relying on
 * both MPI and OpenMP concepts.
 *
 * Application areas of OGS are currently CO2
 * sequestration, geothermal energy, water resources management, hydrology and
 * waste deposition. OGS is comprised of the THMC-simulator (simply referred to as
 * *OGS*) and a visualization tool (*Data Explorer*).
 *
 * OGS is developed by the OpenGeoSys Community.
