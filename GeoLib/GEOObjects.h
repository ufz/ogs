/**
 * \brief Container class for geometric objects.
 *
 * This class contains all the methods necessary for the I/O of geometric objects.
 * Said objects are Points, polylines, Surfaces and Stations and they are stored in
 * vectors (arrays) which are identified by a unique name.
 * For a hierarchical definition, surfaces are bounded by polylines and polylines
 * are defined by points. Therefore, a vector of surfaces references a vector polylines
 * and a vector of polylines references a vector of points, respectively. For
 * identification purposes, all of these vectors have the same name, i.e. the polyline-
 * vector named "aaa" references a point vector "aaa". However, this name ("aaa") is
 * unique among all the vectors of the same class, i.e. there exists only one point-
 * vector with this name, etc.
 * Note: The fact that vectors are uniquely named and the same name is assigned to
 * related objects is automatically handled by this class.
 *
 * For each of these object-classes exists an "add", "remove" and "get"-method which
 * allows for loading/unloading as well as accessing the data, respectively.
 * E.g. for points these methods are "addPointVec(name)", "getPointVec(name)" and
 * "removePointVec(name)". For some objects, additional methods might exist if
 * necessary.
