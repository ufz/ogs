/**
 * \ingroup GeoLib
 *
 * \brief A Station (observation site) is basically a Point with some additional information.
 *
 * Additional information is largely optional (except for a name, but even this may be empty).
 * It may include a name, a stratigraphy (only for the derived class StationBore),
 * time series data from data loggers (as a SensorData-object), etc.
 *
 * Notes concerning the property-system used in this class:
 * Variables of Station and derived classes can be defined to be "properties" of this class (this is entirely optional!).
 * Certain functions in the GUI allow you to modify aspects of the visualisation based on these
 * properties (e.g. filtering operations such as "display only boreholes drilled after 1990 with a
 * depth between 400-800m").
 * To make use of this functionality you need to define properties using the "Station::addProperty()"-method.
 * Parameters for this function include the name of the property as well as a method to read and write the
 * value of the associated variable (see documentation for "addProperty" for details). Furthermore, these read
 * and write-functions need to be actually implemented as static functions to avoid casting problems with the
 * function pointers used to dynamically connect the GUI functionality to the variables defined within the
 * station-classes. Please refer to the documentation of the properties defined below for details.

	 * implemented as static functions, i.e. both the read and the write functin get a void-pointer to the

	 * then be read or written dynamically from that object. It is highly recommended to define both the
	 * read and write function as protected because it does not actually make sense for these functions to be
	 * static except in the context of function pointers. Please refer to the examples below, i.e. the getX
	 * and setX methods.
