 *
 * An observation station as a geometric object. Such a station is basically a point object
 * with some additional information such as colour, a name, etc.
 *
 * Notes concerning the property-system used in this class:
 * Variables of Station and derived classes can be defined to be "properties" of this class.
 * Certain functions in the GUI allow you to modify aspects of the visualisation based on these
 * properties (e.g. filtering operations such as "display only boreholes drilled after 1990 with a
 * depth between 400-800m").
 * To make use of this functionality you need to define properties using the "Station::addProperty()"-method.
 * Parameters for this function include the name of the property as well as a method to read and write the
 * value of the associated variable (see documentation for "addProperty" for details). Furthermore, these read
 * and write-functions need to be actually implemented as static functions to avoid casting problems with the
 * function pointers used to dynamically connect the GUI functionality to the variables defined within the
 * station-classes. Please refer to the documentation of the properties defined below for details.
