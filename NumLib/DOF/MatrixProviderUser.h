/*! Manages storage for vectors.
 *
 * This interface provides storage management semantics for vectors, which
 * can be acquired at a certain point in time, be released later on and
 * be acquired again etc.
 *
 * "Released" means that the caller indicates, that he currently does not need
 * that \c Vector instance, i.e, Either it is not needed anymore for the entire
 * program run, or it is temporarily not needed, but might be aquired again
 * later on. Thereby the implementation of this interface can decide, whether
 * the storage for the specific vector can be freed or reused in the meantime.
 *
 * All get-methods of this class come in two variants: One with an \c id argument,
 * and one without. The latter makes it possible to temporarily release a vector
 * during the program run and re-acquire it again. The former variant is intended
 * as a short-cut that simplifies vector acquisition for callers that will use
 * the same vector throughout all of their lifetime without releasing it
 * intermediately.
 *
 * \attention
 * The first time a vector is acquired by a method with \c id argument, the \c id
 * has to be initialized with zero. The respective method then will set the \c id
 * to the specific \c id of the returned vector.
