/*! A class of linear solver based on PETSc rountines.

 All command-line options that are not recognized by OGS are passed on to
 PETSc, i.e., they potentially affect the linear solver.
 The linear solver options in the project file take precedence over the
 command-line options, because the former are processed at a later stage.
