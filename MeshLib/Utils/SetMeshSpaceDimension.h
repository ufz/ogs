 * meshes.
 *
 * The space dimension is needed for the numerical simulations with a bulk mesh
 * with elements with different dimensions. For example, in a bulk mesh for the
 * numerical simulation of the liquid flow in the fractured porous media, the 1D
 * or 2D elements can be used to represent the fractures, while the elements
 * with higher dimension can be used to discretise the porous medium matrix
 * domain.
 *
 * \param meshes All meshes include the bulk mesh and the meshes for boundary
