## Features

### New processes

- A thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) process, monolithic implementation for Newton non-linear solver. [#2446](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2446)

### Other process' changes
- Non-equilibrium initial state in the small deformation, HM, and TM processes. [#2501](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2501), [#2561](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2561), and [#2544](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2544)
- A reactive transport process, integrated IPhreeqc Module 3.5.0 for reactive transport modeling. [#2494](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2494), [#2512](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2512)
- Fix velocity output in HM. [#2507](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2507)
- Store process' names in the Process class instead of an outside map. [#2534](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2534)
- Generalize permeability models for the fracture flow in LIE/HM:
  - CubicLaw (just generalization). [#2542](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2542)
  - ConstantPermeability. [#2543](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2543)
- Add simple mass lumping to the RichardsMechanics. [#2590](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2590)

#### Numerics

#### Parameter
- new TimeDependentHeterogeneousParameter. [#2588](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2588)
  Feature can be used for time dependent heterogeneous boundary condition or source term specification.

#### Boundary condition

#### Source term

#### Input and output
- HT process: Use MaterialPropertyLibrary for solid phase properties, too. This makes it necessary to changed the project files. [#2487](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2487)
- Reactive transport process: Output time-series amounts of kinetic reactants and equilibrium phases defined under the subtree of chemical system. [#2564](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2564)

### Material models

- Orthotropic elasticity model. [#2428](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2428)
- Dupuit permeability relation. [#2330](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2330)

### File I/O

* Gocad TSurface reader has been added [#2547](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2547)
* Gocad PLine reader has been added [#2586](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2586)

### Testing and documentation

### New tools

* GocadTSurfaceReader command line utility [#2547](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2547)/[#2586](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2586)

### New tools and CLI usage

* Add switch multiple-nodes-allowed to tool constructMeshesFromGeometry, [#2459](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2459)
* Add option to vtkdiff tool to compare meshes using absolute tolerances and connectivity, [#2485](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2485)
* Scalar arrays are copied when using the ExtractSurface-tool, [#2492](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2492)

### Data Explorer

* Mesh to shape export is now writing all cell-based scalar arrays to the DBF-file, [#2436](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2436)
* Added support of world files to georeference arbitrary raster files, [#2460](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2460)
* Scalar arrays are copied when extracting mesh surfaces, [#2492](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2492)
* Gocad TSurfaces can be imported into Data Explorer [#2547](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2547)
* Gocad PLines can be imported into Data Explorer [#2586](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2586)

### Other notable code changes

 * Conversion to linear mesh is now independent of node numbering. [#2519](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/pull/2519)
