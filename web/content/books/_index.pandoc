We publish a series of books and tutorials on OpenGeoSys. The books contain comprehensive benchmark descriptions and can be seen as a reference to what is possible with OGS. The tutorials focus on specific topics such as [Groundwater Flow Modeling]({{< ref "computational-hydrology-i-groundwater-flow-modeling" >}}) or [Models of Thermochemical Heat Storage]({{< ref "models-of-thermochemical-heat-storage" >}}) with step-by-step instructions giving the user a good introduction into modeling and simulation with OGS. Most of the tutorials can be downloaded as PDF! See the detail page on each tutorial.
