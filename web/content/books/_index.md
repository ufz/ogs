We publish a series of books and tutorials on OpenGeoSys. The books contain comprehensive benchmark descriptions and can be seen as a reference to what is possible with OGS. The tutorials focus on specific topics such as [Groundwater Flow Modeling]({{< relref "computational-hydrology-i-groundwater-flow-modeling">}}) or [Thermochemical Heat Storage]() with step-by-step instructions giving the user a good introduction into modeling and simulation with OGS. Most of the tutorials can be downloaded as PDF! See the detail page on each tutorial.
