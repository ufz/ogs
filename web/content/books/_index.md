We publish a series of books on OpenGeoSys. Benchmark books contain comprehensive benchmark descriptions and can be seen as a reference to what is possible with OGS. Tutorial books focus on specific topics with step-by-step instructions giving the user a good introduction into modeling and simulation with OGS. Most of the tutorials can be downloaded as PDF! See the detail page on each tutorial.
