## Equations

We start with simple linear homogeneous elliptic problem:
$$
\begin{equation}
k\; \Delta h = 0 \quad \text{in }\Omega
\end{equation}$$
w.r.t boundary conditions
$$
\eqalign{
h(x) = g_D(x) &\quad \text{on }\Gamma_D,\cr
k\;{\partial h(x) \over \partial n} = g_N(x) &\quad \text{on }\Gamma_N,
}$$

where $h$ could be hydraulic head, the subscripts $D$ and $N$ denote the Dirichlet- and Neumann-type boundary conditions, $n$ is the normal vector pointing outside of $\Omega$, and $\Gamma = \Gamma_D \cup \Gamma_N$ and $\Gamma_D \cap \Gamma_N = \emptyset$.

## Problem specification and analytical solution

We solve the Laplace equation on a square domain $[0\times 1]^2$ with $k = 1$ w.r.t. the specific boundary conditions:
$$
\eqalign{
h(x,y) = 1 &\quad \text{on } (x=0,y) \subset \Gamma_D,\cr
h(x,y) = -1 &\quad \text{on } (x=1,y) \subset \Gamma_D,\cr
k\;{\partial h(x,y) \over \partial n} = 0 &\quad \text{on }\Gamma_N.
}$$
The solution of this problem is
$$
h(x,y) = 1 - 2x.
$$

## Input files

The main project file is `square_1e2.prj`. It describes the processes to be solved and the related process variables together with their initial and boundary conditions. It also references the mesh and geometrical objects defined on the mesh.

As of now a small portion of possible inputs is implemented; one can change:
 - the mesh file
 - the geometry file
 - introduce more/different Dirichlet boundary conditions (different geometry or values)

The geometries used to specify the boundary conditions are given in the `square_1x1.gml` file.

The input mesh `square_1x1_quad_1e2.vtu` is stored in the VTK file format and can be directly visualized in Paraview for example.

## Running simulation

To start the simulation (after successful compilation) run:
```bash
$ ogs square_1e2.prj
```

It will produce some output and write the computed result into the `square_1e2_result.dat`, which is a simple list of values for every node of the mesh.

The output on the console will be similar to the following one (ignore the spurious error messages "Could not find POINT..."):
```
error: GEOObjects::getGeoObject(): Could not find POINT "left" in geometry.
error: GEOObjects::getGeoObject(): Could not find POINT "right" in geometry.
info: Initialize processes.

```

A major part of the output was produced by the linear equation solver (LIS in this case).

## Results and evaluation

<!-- {{< vis path="Elliptic/square_1x1_GroundWaterFlow/square_1e2_pcs_0_ts_1_t_1.000000.vtu" >}} -->

![](../square_1e2_pcs_0_ts_1_t_1.000000.png)

The result, written in the `square_1e2_result.dat`, can be visualized with Paraview, for example, by including the values into the `square_1x1_quad_1e2.vtu` file in the `PointData` section:
```
...


1
0.8
0.6
0.4
0.2
...
-0.6
-0.8
-1


```
(The next releases shall simplify this procedure.)
