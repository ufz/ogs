## Equations

We start with simple linear homogeneous elliptic problem:
$$
\begin{equation}
k\; \Delta h = 0 \quad \text{in }\Omega
\end{equation}$$
w.r.t boundary conditions
$$
\eqalign{
h(x) = g_D(x) &\quad \text{on }\Gamma_D,\cr
k{\partial h(x) \over \partial n} = g_N(x) &\quad \text{on }\Gamma_N,
}$$
where $h$ could be hydraulic head, the subscripts $D$ and $N$ denote the Dirichlet- and Neumann-type boundary conditions, $n$ is the normal vector pointing outside of $\Omega$, and $\Gamma = \Gamma_D \cup \Gamma_N$ and $\Gamma_D \cap \Gamma_N = \emptyset$.

## Problem specification and analytical solution

We solve the Laplace equation on a square domain $[0\times 1]^2$ with $k = 1$ w.r.t. the specific boundary conditions:

$$
\eqalign{
h(x,y) = 1 &\quad \text{on } (x=0,y) \subset \Gamma_D,\cr
h(x,y) = 1 &\quad \text{on } (x,y=0) \subset \Gamma_D,\cr
k {\partial h(x,y) \over \partial n} = 1 &\quad \text{on } (x=1,y) \subset \Gamma_N,\cr
k {\partial h(x,y) \over \partial n} = 0 &\quad \text{on } (x,y=1) \subset \Gamma_N.
}$$

The solution of this problem is
$$
\begin{equation}
h(x,y) = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^\infty A_k \sin\bigg(C_k y\bigg) \sinh\bigg(C_k x\bigg),
\end{equation}
$$
where $C_k = \frac{2k-1}{2} \pi$ and $A_k = 2 \Big/ \Big(C_k^2 \cosh\big(C_k\big)\Big)$.

## Input files

The main project file is [square_1e2_neumann.prj](https://github.com/ufz/ogs-data/blob/master/Elliptic/square_1x1_GroundWaterFlow/square_1e2.prj). It describes the processes to be solved and the related process variables together with their initial and boundary conditions. It also references the mesh and geometrical objects defined on the mesh.

As of now a small portion of possible inputs is implemented; one can change:
 - the mesh file
 - the geometry file
 - introduce more/different Dirichlet boundary conditions (different geometry or other constant values)
 - introduce more/different Neumann boundary conditions (different geometry or other constant values)

The geometries used to specify the boundary conditions are given in the [square_1x1.gml](https://github.com/ufz/ogs-data/blob/master/Elliptic/square_1x1_GroundWaterFlow/square_1x1.gml) file.

The input mesh `square_1x1_quad_1e2.vtu` is stored in the VTK file format and can be directly visualized in Paraview for example.

## Running simulation

To start the simulation (after successful compilation) run:
```bash
$ ogs square_1e2_neumann.prj
```

It will produce some output and write the computed result into the `square_1e2_neumann.vtu` for visualization with Paraview.

The output on the console will be similar to the following one (ignore the spurious error messages "Could not find POINT..."):

A last major part of the output was produced by the linear equation solver (LIS in this case) showing good convergence.

## Results and evaluation

<!-- {{< vis path="Elliptic/square_1x1_GroundWaterFlow/square_1e2_neumann_pcs_0_ts_1_t_1.000000.vtu" >}} -->

Compared to the analytical solution presented above the results are very good but in a single point:

{{< img src="../square_1e2_neumann_abs_err.png" >}}

Both Dirichlet boundary conditions are satisfied.
The values of gradients in x direction along the right side and y directions along the top sides of the domain a shown below:

{{< img src="../square_1e2_neumann_gradients.png" >}}

The homogeneous Neumann boundary condition on the top side is satisfied (ScalarGradient_Y is close to zero).
The inhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition on the bottom is satisfied only for $y > 0.3$ (where the ScalarGradient_X is close to one) because of incompatible boundary conditions imposed on the bottom right corner of the domain.
