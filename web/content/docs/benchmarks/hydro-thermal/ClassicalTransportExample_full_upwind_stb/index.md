### Purpose

This example tests the full upwind stabilization scheme, the type name of which
 is `FullUpwind`.

### Theory

For the full upwind scheme, we consider the general advection term of the
advection  diffusion transport equation:
$$
     \nabla \cdot ( u \mathbf{v}),
$$
where $u$ can be temperature $ T$ or mass component
concentration $C$, and $\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity.
This means $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}$ may not be zero, or physically
the fluid flow may be compressible.

The discretized weak form of that advection term takes the form
$$
         \int_{\Omega_e}  \nabla \cdot ( u \mathbf{v})
                 \phi_i \mathrm{d} \Omega
               =  \int_{\Omega_e}  \nabla \cdot ( u \mathbf{v} \phi_i)
                  \mathrm{d} \Omega - \int_{\Omega_e} \nabla \phi_i
                   \cdot ( u \mathbf{v} )  \mathrm{d} \Omega
$$
with $\phi_i$ the test function.
The first term on the right hand side can be converted to boundary
integration according to the Green's theorem as
$$
                \int_{\Omega_e}  \nabla \cdot ( u \mathbf{v} \phi_i)
                  \mathrm{d} \Omega
                = \int_{\partial\Omega_e}  ( u \mathbf{v} \phi_i) \cdot
                     \mathbf{n} \mathrm{d} \Gamma
$$
with $\mathbf{n}$ the normal to the boundary surface. That
boundary integration is a part of Neumann boundary condition.
Therefore what left for the element integration is
$$
             -\int_{\Omega_e} \nabla \phi_i
                   \cdot ( u \mathbf{v} )  \mathrm{d} \Omega,
$$
which is denoted as $R_i$ hereafter.

Based on the scheme introduced by Dalen [[1]](#1), the full upwind
scheme evaluates the following flux related quantity for each node
$$
        q_i = -\int_{\Omega_e} \nabla \phi_i
                   \cdot  \mathbf{v}  \mathrm{d} \Omega
$$
to determine whether it is an upwind node. If $q_i>0$, node $i$ is
at upwind position.

Let
$$
        q_{up} = \sum_{q_i >= 0} q_i u_i
$$
be the total flux at the upwind nodes, and
$$
        q_{down} = \sum_{q_i < 0} q_i
$$
be the total flux related quantity at the down nodes, we can approximate
the discretized weak form of the advection term as:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
          R_i
           \approx
            \begin{cases}
              q_i\,u_i,\forall q_i >= 0,  \newline
              q_i \frac{q_{up}}{q_{down}},\forall q_i < 0
            \end{cases}
 =            \begin{cases}
              q_i\,u_i,\forall q_i \>= 0\newline
              \frac{1}{q_{down}} q_i {\sum_{q_j >= 0} (q_j u_j)},\forall
              q_i < 0
            \end{cases}=\tilde R_i.
\end{eqnarray}
$$
The above approximation defines the full upwind scheme of the advection term
of the advection diffusion transport equation for the FEM analysis.
Obviously, we see that
$$
 \begin{eqnarray}
   \sum_i   \tilde R_i &=& \sum_{q_i >= 0} q_i u_i + \sum_{q_i < 0}
  \frac{1}{q_{down}} q_i {\sum_{q_j >= 0} (q_j u_j)}\newline
     &=& \sum_{q_i >= 0} q_i u_i +
  \frac{\sum_{q_i < 0} q_i}{q_{down}}  {\sum_{q_j >= 0} (q_j u_j)}
   = q_{up}-q_{up} = 0,
\end{eqnarray}
$$
which means that the nodal mass balance of element is guaranteed.

### Example and its results

The example is described in [Classical transport example:
 using the isotropic diffusion stabilization]({{< relref "ClassicalTransportExample_isotropic_diffusion_stb" >}}).

The following two figures compare the example results with the analytical solution
 and that are obtained by using the isotropic diffusion stabilization.
{{< figure src="classical_transport_example_full_upwind.png" >}}

From the figures we can see that the full upwind scheme adds more diffusion than the
 isotropic diffusion scheme does.
