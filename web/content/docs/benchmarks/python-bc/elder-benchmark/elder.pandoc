## Motivation of this test case

The aim of this test is:

* to show that it is possible to prescribe BCs only on parts of a given geometry
* to assert that Python BCs work with processes involving more than one physical
  field.

## Details

This test is a copy of [this test case]({{< ref "../../hydro-component/elder" >}}).
