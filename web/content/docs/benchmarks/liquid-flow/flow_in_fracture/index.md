There are four tests for the finite element analyses with inclined elements,
 which are the benchmarks to simulate the saturated single phase flow in fractured
 porous media. The correctness of the implementation of the
  inclined element approach is verified by the obtained flow, or flow velocity,
 orientation of these four benchmarks.

## Flow in an inclined plane

Under this topic, there are two benchmarks using the same 2D mesh on an inclined
 plane. The input files are given in the sub-directory of Inclined2DMesh,
 which includes one for hydro-steady state flow and another for transient flow
 under the fixed pressure difference on the top and the bottom boundary and
 the gravitational force.
For the hydro-steady state one, it gives zero velocity. For the transient
 simulation, the orientation calculated velocity is shown in the following
 figure, which is parallel to the mesh plane as what expected.

## Flow in rock matrix with two intersected fractures

 The input files are given in the sub-directory of FractureIn3D.
This benchmark tests the case of the mesh contains both 3D elements
 and inclined 2D element.
The analysed  domain has two intersected fractures. The brick shape domain is
 discretised into tetrahedra, while the two planes are discretised
 into triangles. The permeability of the continuous domain is
$$k_{xx}=1.0\cdot 10^{-18}, k_{yy}=3.0\cdot 10^{-18}, k_{xx}=3.0\cdot 10^{-18}\,
 \text{m}^2,$$
and
the permeability of
 fractures are $$ 10^{-14}\, \text{m}^2, \quad \text{and }  10^{-15}\, \text{m}^2,$$
 respectively. The flow is
 driven by the fixed pressure difference on the top and the bottom boundaries
 and the gravity. The following figure shows the pressure distribution and
 the flow orientation on the fractures. It can be seen that the flow orientation
 is exactly parallel to the fracture planes as what expected.

## Line elements on a sphere

The input files are given in the sub-directory of 1Din3D.
This an artificial example is used to test the simulation with a mesh only with
 inclined line elements. A sphere surface is used to discretise into triangle
 elements, and then all the edges of the elements are used as line elements of
 the mesh for this benchmark. That means all lines elements are on a sphere.
A fixed pressure difference is applied at the two poles of the sphere. As shown
 in the following figure, the computed flow orientation is exactly on
 the tangent of the boundary of the vertical splices of the sphere.
