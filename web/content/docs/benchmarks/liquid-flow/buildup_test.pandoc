Problem description {#problem-description .unnumbered .unnumbered}
===================

The pressure buildup test is performed by shutting in a producing well
at time $t=t_p$, after which a smooth rise of the well head pressure can
be observed. For a geothermal reservoir, the buildup test result is
interpreted using a Horner plot in order to evaluate the reservoir
permeability or transmissivity. In this benchmark, observation data from
a geothermal well is employed to parameterize the numerical model. In
the model, a time dependent nodal source term was set up to represent
the shut-in operation. The simulated pressure profile is then verified
against the analytical solution.

Model Setup {#model-setup .unnumbered .unnumbered}
===========

This benchmark represents a scenario in which the well had been
producing geothermal brine for $118\ \mathrm{h}$ at a rate of
$78\ t/\mathrm{h}$ and was then shut in for a buildup test. At the given
reservoir temperature (260$^\circ$C) and pressure ($47\ \mathrm{bar}$), the
density and viscosity of the water and steam mixture were calculated as
$\rho=78.68\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}$ and
$\mu=1.295\times10^{-4}\ \mathrm{Pa\ s}$. The compressibility of the
mixture was estimated as $nc_t=0.0805\ \mathrm{bar^{-1}}$ ($n$ refers to
the porosity of the reservoir), which yields a specific storage
coefficient of $S=\rho gnc_t=6.21\times 10^{-4}\ \mathrm{m^{-1}}$. The
observed pressure readings during the buildup test are cited from
Chapter 6 of the book *Geothermal Power Generation*
[1], and the data is archived in the Appendix.

The permeability of the reservoir can be estimated by means of a Horner
plot, in which the pressure $p$ is plotted against
$(t_p+\Delta t)/\Delta t$, i.e. Horner time on a semi-logarithmic scale
(cf. Figure 1). In the Horner plot, the data points form a
straight line in the late-time period of the test. Note that the time
increases in the opposite direction of the *X*-axis. Therefore, the
linear section appears at the left side of the diagram.

Figure 1: Horner plot ($p$ vs $(t_p+\Delta t)/\Delta t$) for buildup test showing the inferred Horner straight line


The slope $m$ of the Horner straight line is expressed as:
$$m=0.1832\frac{Q\mu}{\kappa b}$$ in which $Q\  \mathrm{[L^3/T]}\ (Q>0)$
is the production rate of the well before shut-in,
$\kappa\ \mathrm{[L^2]}$ is the permeability and $b\ \mathrm{[L]}$ is
the aquifer thickness. From the Horner plot, we can infer a Horner
straight line with a slope of $m=0.79$. Therefore the transmissivity of
the aquifer can be calculated as $$\begin{aligned}
\kappa b&=&0.1832\frac{Q\mu}{m}=0.1832\frac{((78000/3600)/78.68)\times1.295\times10^{-4}}{7.09\times10^5}\\&=&9.2\times10^{-12}\ \mathrm{m^3}\end{aligned}$$
In addition, the straight line in the Horner plot can be extracted to a Horner time of 1,
which corresponds to the infinite shut-in time $(\Delta t)$. This leads to
an extrapolated pressure $p_0$ of $67.5~\mathrm{kPa}$, which is the
undisturbed reservoir pressure .

Input files {#input-files .unnumbered .unnumbered}
===========

The benchmark project is defined in the input file `buildup_test.prj`. It defines the process to
be solved as "LiquidFlow" and the primary variable is hence pressure.
The initial condition is set to $p_0=67.5\ \mathrm{bar}$ and the
undisturbed boundary is achieved by a large domain size
$(r=1000\ \mathrm{m})$. The time-dependent source term is applied in this
benchmark. From the beginning until $t=424800$ sec, the pumping rate was
maintained at a constant rate. Afterwards, the well is shut-in and pressure
starts to build up. The geometries used to specify the model domain, boundary
conditions, and source term can be found in `line_1000_axi.gml` file.
The mesh is specified in `line_1000_axi.vtu`, which is stored in the
VTK format and can be directly visualized in Paraview.

Analytical solution {#analytical-solution .unnumbered .unnumbered}
===================

The pressure buildup test is comparable to a pumping recovery test as
the extraction rate is first kept constant at $Q$, and then becomes zero
at $t=t_p$. This benchmark then adopts the same assumptions as in the
[Theis'
problem](https://benchmarks.opengeosys.org/docs/benchmarks/liquid-flow/liquid-flow-theis-problem/).
The analytical solution of the pressure difference $\Delta p$ with
respect to the initial pressure $p_0$ is the sum of two Theis curves:
one starting at $t=0$ and another starting at $t=t_p$ but with an
opposite extraction rate, i.e. for $t\leq t_p$,
$$\Delta p=\rho g \frac{-Q}{4\pi T}W\left(\frac{r^2S}{4Tt}\right)$$ and
for $t>t_p$,
$$\Delta p=\rho g \frac{-Q}{4\pi T}W\left(\frac{r^2S}{4Tt}\right)+\rho g \frac{Q}{4\pi T}W\left(\frac{r^2S}{4T(t-t_p)}\right)$$

Results and evaluation {#results-and-evaluation .unnumbered .unnumbered}
======================

The pressure evolution is simulated throughout the domain and the result
is compared with the analytical solution at $r=10.287\ \mathrm{m}$. In
Figure 2, it can be observed that the numerical model
fits with the analytical solution very well. The absolute and relative
error between the analytical and numerical solution is depicted in
Figure 3.
