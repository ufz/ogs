This is an example to test the fixed stress splitting with the approach of fixed
 stress rate over time step (see the algorithms in
 [Injection and Production in 1D Linear Poroelastic
  Medium with the Staggered Scheme]({{< relref "InjectionProduction" >}})).

We consider a porous column bounded by rigid and impermeable walls, except on
its top where a mechanical pressure load $\sigma_0$ is prescribed and which is free to
drain. Suppose that the length of the column is H. The boundary and initial
conditions for the problem are

$$
\eqalign{
&\sigma =\sigma_0, p = 0\, \text{on}\, x=0,\cr
&u=0, \dfrac{\partial p}{\partial x}=0\, \text{on}\, x=H,\cr
&\sigma = p = 0\, \text{at}\, t=0.
}
$$

By omitting the body force, assuming zero liquid storage and homogeneous
 material, the analytical solution for this problem can be found in [1,2] as

$$
\eqalign{
&\sigma_D=-1+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \dfrac{2}{M}\sin(Mx_D)\exp^{-M^2t_D}, \cr
&u_D=1-x_D-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \dfrac{2}{M}\cos(Mx_D)\exp^{-M^2t_D}, \cr
&p_D =\sigma_D+1,
}
$$

where the $x_D = x/H$, $t_D = (\lambda + 2\mu)kt/\eta H^2$, and $M = 1/2\pi(2n + 1)$
 are the non-dimensional quantities,
and $\sigma_D = \sigma/p_0$, $u_D = u(\lambda + 2 G)/p_0 H$, and $p_D = p/p_0$
 are the dimensionless effective stress, the displacement, and the pore pressure,
respectively. $\lambda$ is the Lame constant, and $G$ is the shear modulus.

Since the storage is zero, the pressure change in this example is purely driven
 by the strain change.

In this example, we see that the densities can be arbitrary
 non-zero values. The values of the required material parameters are given in
 the following table:

| Parameter |Value  |Unit |
|---|---|---|
| Young's modulus  | $3\cdot 10^4$ |Pa   |
| Poisson's ratio  | $0.2$  | -  |
| Permeability  |$10^{-10}$  | $\text{m}^2$  |
| Viscosity | $10^{-3}$ |Pa s|

The mechanical load on the top boundary is 1000 Pa, i.e. $\sigma_0 = -1000$ Pa.

In the following figures, the solutions at $t=10$ s obtained by using the staggered scheme
 with fixed stress rate over time step, the monolithic scheme, and analytic
 approach are compared.

The figures show that for the staggered scheme
 with fixed stress rate over time step, the solutions with $dt=0.5$ s are quite
 close to the analytical ones.
