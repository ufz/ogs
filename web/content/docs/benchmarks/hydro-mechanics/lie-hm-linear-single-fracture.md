## Equations

We solve a hydromechanics problem (small deformation, linear elastic, Darcy flow) with a pre-existing fracture using the lower-dimensional interface element (LIE) approach.

See the TODO: {asset:843:link}-PDF for detailed problem description.


## Results and evaluation

Result showing pore pressure increase due to the injection and subsequent fracture aperture increases at t=500s. A small discrepancy of the aperture near the injection is due to the interpolation method for converting cell data to point data in ParaView.
