## Problem description

We solve a non-linear small deformation problem on a cube with shear traction on the top boundary face. The 3D problem is setup identical to the corresponding 2D problem.

See the TODO: {asset:795:link}-PDF for detailed problem description.

## Results and evaluation

Result showing the displacement field and distortion relative to the initial configuration:

Displacement of the top surface in the direction of the shear traction over time showing the elastic and viscous deformations (creep):
