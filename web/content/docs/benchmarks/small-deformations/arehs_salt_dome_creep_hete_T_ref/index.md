This plane strain creep problem is based on the conceptional model of salt dome presented
  in Bruns [[1]](#1) and one of the benchmarks of the AREHS project
 (<https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e908e022978e30001bc6b44>).
 It is used here to test the use of the element wise distributed
 reference temperature.

The 2D domain is a rectangle with a size of 6000 m $\times$ 3000 m. The
 displacement in the normal direction of the lateral and the bottom boundaries are fixed.
The top boundary is traction free.
The BGRa creep model with the parameters of  $A=0.18\, \mbox{d}^{-1}$,
$m=5$, $Q=54 \mbox{ kJ/mol}$ is used for the creep analysis.
The other material parameters are listed in the following table:

|   | Over burden  | Cap rock  | Salt rock  | Basement  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  Youngs' modulus [GPa]|   7.7| 15.6  |  25.0 | 15.6  |
|  Poisson ratio | 0.28  | 0.3  |  0.25 |   0.3|
|  Density [kg/m$^3$]| 1925.0  | 2700.0  | 2140.0  |2700   |

The reference temperature is shown in the following figure:

The initial stresses were obtained by conducting a simulation of the pure elastic
deformation in the same domain under the gravitational force.

As a benchmark, only one thousand years' creep with  six time steps is considered.

The following two figures shown the results of stress magnitude and displacement
magnitude at the last time step:
