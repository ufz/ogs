## Problem description

We solve a linear elastic small deformation problem with a pre-existing fracture using the lower-dimensional interface element (LIE) approach.

See [this PDF](LIE_small_deformation.pdf) for detailed problem description.

The one-sided incompressibility constraint for fracture models is described in
[this PDF](LIE_fracture_incompressibility.pdf).

## Results and evaluation

Result showing sliding of the upper part of the domain along the fracture:

Same benchmark setup with plane strain conditions in 3D:

Comparison with 2D setup yields identical results (up to numerical differences
in order of 1e-15); Resulting displacement on the left axis, and error on the
right:
