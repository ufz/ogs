## Overview

For detailed description see [technical note
PDF](non-equilibrium_initial_states.pdf); here only excerpts from the
document are shown.

In certain conditions we want to drive changes in the process only by a change
in the external driving forces and suppress the initial equilibration.
Three test cases are showing a full simulation from equilibrium initial state,
a restart with equilibrium, and calculation from non-equilibrium initial state.
