## Overview

This benchmark was originally described in Kolditz et al. (2012) as a reactive transport benchmark including precipitation and dissolution reactions along a saturated column of calcite which is fluxed with a diluted solution of $\mathrm{MgCl}_2$. Three different codes (OGS.5-ChemApp, OGS.5-iPHREEQC and OGS.5-GEMS) were used in that exercise.
Kolditz et al. (2012) considered that all reactions occurred at thermodynamic equilibrium. Later on, in He et al. (2015) and Jang et al. (2018), the incorporation of kinetic rates for reaction precipitations in OGS.5-iPHREEQC was investigated and compared with the modelling results obtained with OGS.5-ChemApp and PHREEQC.
Very briefly, the studied system consists on a column of 0.5 m, initially containing crushed calcite ($\mathrm{CaCO}_3$(s)), which is continuously fluxed with a 1 millimolar (mmol/L) magnesium chloride ($\mathrm{MgCl}_2$) solution at pH = 7 and 25°C during 350 min (~ 5.8h) at a constant flow rate of 0.18 L/min.
Previous to the experiment, the column had been packed giving a mean bulk density and porosity of 1.80 Kg/L and 0.32, respectively. The column was saturated and equilibrated by injecting pure water giving a saturated solution with respect calcite and pH = 9.9.


## Model setup

The operator-splitting (OS) model formulation (Strang, 1968) with a sequential non-iterative approach (SNIA) has been used to implement the reactive component transport processes in saturated porous media illustrated in this benchmark. In a ﬁrst step, the mass balance equations describing each component transport present in the fluid is solved according to


### Model results

A comparison of the numerical data is shown in the figure below. The numerical results of OGS-6 are in good agreement with those of OGS-5. The maximum number of absolute error in terms of varying element concentrations is $2.15\times10^{-5}$ ($\mathrm{Cl}$), $1.13\times10^{-5}$ ($\mathrm{Mg}$), and $4.57\times10^{-6}$ ($\mathrm{Ca}$).
