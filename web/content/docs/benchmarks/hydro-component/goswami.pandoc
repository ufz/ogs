## Overview

This benchmark features an Henry-like variable-density flow and transport setup that evaluates saltwater intrusion on laboratory scale. The original benchmark was published by Goswami & Clement (2007); OpenGeoSys5 has been verified for all steady and transient states of the original benchmark (see Kolditz et al., 2012).

For the setup and parameterization, see the chapter "Density dependent flow - The Goswami Problem" in Kolditz et al. (2012).


## Problem description

The Goswami-Clement benchmark is based on experiment observations for intruding and receding saltwater in a laboratory-scale sand tank. Here, we compare numerical results of ogs6 to the original observation data.

### Model results
An example for the intruding salt front is shown below. The numerical results of OGS-6 coincide with those of OGS-5.

A comparison of numerical and laboratory data is shown in the figure below. The numerical results of ogs6 coincide with those of OGS5 and likewise with the laboratory observations.
