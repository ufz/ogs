## Introduction

[GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) is a powerful [Continuous Integration](../../development-workflows/continuous-integration/) system integrated into GitLab.

The tasks of the CI system are configured in [scripts inside the OGS source code](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/tree/master/scripts/ci). The entry point is defined in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml). Scripting and versioning the configuration together with the source code is very powerful, e.g. if you introduce a new OGS CMake configuration in a merge request even the change of the CI jobs configuration or jobs environment (Docker container definition) can be part of the merge request.

## GitLab Pipeline

A CI run consists of a [pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/) which contains [stages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#stages) which in turn contain jobs. A job runs a set of instructions (e.g. checking out the source code, building the code, testing the code) on a [runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).

Each pipeline run is visualized as follows:

Jobs belong to a stage and each job will get a status (success, warnings, failure). Some jobs are optional (see the gear icon) and can be manually triggered by pressing the play button.

## Automatic testing

The master-branch of the main repository as well as all merge requests on that repository are automatically tested. See [the pipelines page](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/pipelines).

### Skip automatic testing

If you want to skip a pipeline run for a push add the `-o ci.skip` git push option. Example:

```bash
git push -o ci.skip
```

Or add `[ci skip]` to the commit message to skip the pipeline for this commit. Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Added feature X [ci skip]"
```

Or use the merge request label `ci::skip`.

## (Temporarily) reduce pipeline run time

During work on MR you may want to reduce the pipeline run time to get feedback faster. You can use a pre-configured reduced pipeline or manually editing the pipeline configuration files.

## Pre-configured reduced pipelines

These pipelines can be selected by using merge request labels:

- `ci::web only`: Runs Jupyter notebook ctests only and builds the web site.
- `ci::linux only` and `ci::mac only` and `ci::win only`: Runs platform specific builds only.

## More MR labels affecting CI pipelines

- `ci_large` for enabling large ctests in merge request pipelines. Combine with `ci::linux only` for faster feedback on the benchmarks.

### Manually editing `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `scripts/ci/pipelines/regular.yml`

You can change the pipeline by editing the `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `scripts/ci/jobs/*.yml` files. It is good practice to mark these changes with commits starting with `drop: ...` in the commit message so they can be removed later easily.

These variables in `.gitlab-ci.yml` modify the pipeline:

- `BUILD_TESTS`: Set this to `false` to disable unit tests.
- `BUILD_CTEST`: Set this to `false` to disable CTest (benchmark) tests.
- `CTEST_ARGS`: Supply additional arguments to the `ctest`-command to select which benchmarks are run, e.g.:
  - `-R nb` would select all notebook-based tests and would disable all other benchmarks
  - `-LE large` would exclude all tests with label `large`

All jobs get included in the `include:`-section in the file `scripts/ci/pipelines/regular.yml`. You can simple comment out files to disable jobs defined in that files. Please note that some jobs depend on other jobs.

### `scripts/ci/jobs/*.yml`

All jobs are defined in these files. You can disable a single job by prefixing its name with a dot, e.g.:

```yml
# enabled job:
build linux arch:

# disabled job:
.build linux arch:
```
