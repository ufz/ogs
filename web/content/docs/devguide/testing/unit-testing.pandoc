## Introdution

[Unit testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) can be used for testing small pieces of functionality. We use [googletest](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_6_Primer) as our test framework.

## Running Tests

Googletest is already included in the OGS source code. Running tests is as simple as building the `tests`-target.

## Writing Tests

All tests are located inside the *Tests*-directory in library-specific subfolders. To write a new test you simply create a new *.cpp*-file and use the googletest macros.
