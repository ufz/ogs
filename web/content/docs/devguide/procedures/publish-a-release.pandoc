## Write a changelog

Update the [changelog](https://github.com/ufz/ogs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) with a short summary of your merged pull requests.

To get a list of your PRs since the last tag:

```bash
$ git log --merges 6.0.5.. --oneline | grep bilke
```

where `6.0.5` is the last tag and `bilke` is to be substituted by your GitHub user name. This outputs:

```
0447b58 Merge pull request #1234 from bilke/remove-osg-converter
a26da79 Merge pull request #1230 from bilke/disallow-win-32bit
6db9bf6 Merge pull request #1231 from bilke/ctest-large
...
```

To find out more about a PR use `git show`:

```bash
$ git show a26da79

    Merge pull request #1230 from bilke/disallow-win-32bit

    Disallow 32-bit Windows builds.
```

And use `git log` with the second hash after `Merge:`:

```bash
$ git log 5f78991
ommit 5f78991528e240d75fd341e1915213e030d4d2a2

...
```
