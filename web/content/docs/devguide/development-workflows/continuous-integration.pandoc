## Introduction

> [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (short **CI**) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

So for every proposed change to the source code the following is done automatically:

- Compilation of the changed code merged with the official source code is tested on a variety of platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, different compilers)
- A comprehensive [test suite]({{< ref "unit-testing.pandoc" >}}) checks validity of the proposed changes
- Additional checks regarding code formatting and documentation help in maintaining a good software quality and structure

After the system is done with all these tasks the developer can view build reports highlighting occurred errors and problems. We are using [Jenkins]({{< ref "jenkins.pandoc" >}}) as our CI system.

## CI on OGS

All of this automatically kicks in when you open a [Pull Request](../code-reviews) on GitHub. You will notice a checks block at the end of the pull request page:

Click on the *Details* link to find out the reason for a failed check. If you add more commits to this pull request all checks are run again.

# Enable CI on your fork

You can have the CI system testing all your branches in your fork of OGS even before creating a pull request. See the page on [Jenkins]({{< ref "jenkins.pandoc#automatic-testing-for-own-repository" >}}) for further information.
