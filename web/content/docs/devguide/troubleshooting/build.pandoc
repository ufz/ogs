## Visual Studio out-of-heap or stackoverflow errors

The compilation especially of the processes in Release-config can be very memory hungry. Using dynamic Eigen shape matrices can reduce memory usage:

```
cmake . -DOGS_EIGEN_DYNAMIC_SHAPE_MATRICES=ON
```

You should also have at least 8 GB of RAM and even this can be not enough when compiling on multiple cores (which is the default). To build on only one core run the following in your build-directory:

```
cmake --build . --config Release -j 1
```

If this still fails you can disable building of the failing processes, e.g.:

```
cmake . -DOGS_BUILD_PROCESS_HT=OFF
cmake --build . --config Release -j 1

## Cotire-related (pre-compiled headers)

If you get some error during build which mentions `cotire` or `*.prefix.hxx.gch` you can try to clean the pre-compiled headers with:

```bash
make clean_cotire
```

This may occur after updating the compiler or system libraries. Related to configurations with `OGS_USE_PCH=ON` only.
