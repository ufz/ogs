## Cotire-related (pre-compiled headers)

If you get some error during build which mentions `cotire` or `*.prefix.hxx.gch` you can try to clean the pre-compiled headers with:

```bash
make clean_cotire
```

This may occur after updating the compiler or system libraries. Related to configurations with `OGS_USE_PCH=ON` only.
