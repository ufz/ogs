## <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> General advice

If something goes wrong when running CMake please try again with an **empty** or newly created build-directory! This is very first thing you should try!

Please read the CMake output carefully. Often it will tell you what went wrong.

Check also [Conans troubleshooting page]({{< ref "conan.pandoc" >}}) if you use Conan for dependencies.
