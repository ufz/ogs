## Introduction

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) is a web-based Git repository manager similar to [GitHub](https://github.com). GitLab can be self-hosted and we do just that with <https://gitlab.opengeosys.org>. For the moment all OGS repositories are still hosted at [github.com/ufz](https://github.com/ufz) but we store benchmark data files on our own GitLab because of storage limits on GitHub.

## Setup an account

- Creating a GitLab account can be done by simply using your existing GitHub account: click the GitHub logo (octocat) on the [Gitlab sign-in page](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/users/sign_in)

  - You will be redirected to GitHub (please login there) and asked for authorization.
  - Your new user account will be blocked at first, please let us know we will unblock it

## Setup a password for cloning over https

To clone a repository via `https://`-protocol you need to [set up an account password](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/profile/password/edit) and use this during `git clone https://...`.

## Upload a SSH key for cloning over SSH

To clone a repository via SSH-protocol (`git clone git@gitlab...`) you need to [upload your SSH pubic key](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/profile/keys).
