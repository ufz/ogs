## Introduction

If a binary runs on a different machine depends on a lot of factors. The following sections provide some tips to maximize portability. In general Windows binaries are more portable than *nix binaries.

## CPU Architecture Optimization

::: {.win}
### Default compiler flags

- `/favor:blend`: Optimizes for AMD **and** Intel architectures, see [MSDN docs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173505.aspx)
- `/arch:sse2` on [32-bit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us//library/7t5yh4fd.aspx), `/arch` undefined on [64-bit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj620901.aspx)

### Optimization CMake options

- `OGS_CPU_ARCHITECTURE`: possible values `AMD64` or `INTEL64` (sets `/favor:{AMD64 | INTEL64}` flag)
- `OGS_ENABLE_AVX2`: boolean (sets `/arch:AVX2` when set to true), requires at least [Intel Haswell or AMD Excavator-based processors](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us//library/7t5yh4fd.aspx)

::: {.linux}
### Default compiler flags

- `-march=native`: Optimizes for current cpu

### CMake options

#### For redistribution

- `OGS_CPU_ARCHITECTURE`: set to `generic` for good balance between optimization and portability; set to `core2` for maximum portability, more info on [gcc docs](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/x86-Options.html#index-mtune-15)

#### For optimization

- `OGS_CPU_ARCHITECTURE`: tot to `native` for best optimization for your current cpu, possible values are [listed here](http:/bilityoverflow.com/a/25095818/80480), more info on [gcc docs](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/x86-Options.html#index-mtune-15)
- `OGS_ENABLE_AVX2`: boolean (sets `-march=core-avx2` when set to true), requires at least Haswell processors

## Shared vs. static libraries

Try to use static libraries as much as possible. For OGS itself use `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`, which already defaults to `OFF`.

Third-party libraries installed via the systems package package manager are often provided as shared libraries. You may want to use [Conan]({{< ref "conan-package-manager.pandoc" >}}) which provides lots of libraries (e.g. VTK) as static libs.

## Package the build

Use the `package`-target which tries to gather all dependencies and fixes up shared library paths:

```bash
make package
```

This creates a zip- or tar-archive which should be redistributable.
