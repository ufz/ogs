In this help section you will find everything related to development. Please walk through the Getting Started-section **step by step**. At the end you will have the latest OGS source code, the OGS finite element simulator compiled and everything you need to start developing for OGS! This first section of the developer guide will give you just a brief introduction, make sure to read the more advanced topics after you have familiarized yourself with the basics.

Instructions may differ depending on your operating system (OS). Be sure to pick the right one in the **OS selector** at the top of the **next page**.
