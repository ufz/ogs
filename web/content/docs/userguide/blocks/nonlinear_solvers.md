Following non-linear solvers are available in OpenGeoSys:

- [Newton](/docs/userguide/blocks/nonlinear_solvers/#newton)
- [Picard](/docs/userguide/blocks/nonlinear_solvers/#picard)

## Newton

<!-- TODO: add content -->

The nonlinear solver of "Newton" type is an implementation of the Newton-Raphson method.
The basic definition of the non-linear solver with "Newton" follows this template:

```xml
<nonlinear_solver>
    <name>basic_newton</name>
    <type>Newton</type>
    <max_iter>10</max_iter>
    <linear_solver>linear_solver</linear_solver>
</nonlinear_solver>
```

## Picard

<!-- TODO: add content -->

The nonlinear solver of "Picard" type is an implementation of the Picard-Iteration method.
The basic definition of the non-linear solver with "Picard" follows this template:

```xml
<nonlinear_solver>
    <name>basic_picard</name>
    <type>Picard</type>
    <max_iter>100</max_iter>
    <linear_solver>linear_solver</linear_solver>
</nonlinear_solver>
```
