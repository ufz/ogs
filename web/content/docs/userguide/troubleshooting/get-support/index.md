If you encounter issues using or developing OGS let us know. To help you in the best possible way, we need detailed information
about the problem from you. In the best case we can reproduce the issue by ourselves and possibly fix it for you. Please provide
the following information:

### Report contents

- Output of `ogs --version` (e.g., version number or git commit hash and CMake arguments)
- How did you obtain the program (e.g., self-compiled or as a binary download from the web site)
- Operating system / hardware information (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04, Intel i5-10600K, 16 GB Ram)
- Description of the issue:
  - Steps to reproduce the issue
  - **Full log output** as plain text (-file) (e.g., full compiler output including CMake run or output of a simulation run of
  OGS)! Please **do not** send screenshots of error messages! Instead copy and paste from your terminal application into the
  report!
  - Information about your environment (e.g. did you installed any OGS dependencies as system packages)
  - Information about the OGS configuration (e.g., debug or release, serial or parallel, MFront?, ...)

Feel free to skip things from the list if you think they are not related to the issue but in general: the more information the
better.
