You can run your first OGS simulation in 5 minutes if you start with one of the many existing test cases.  
But OGS is a large tool and has much more to offer! It may take some time to master it, but we promise it is worth it.

As a simple example we take the [disc with a hole benchmark test case](/docs/benchmarks/small-deformations/linear_disc_with_hole) from
our benchmark gallery.
This benchmark analyzes the stress distribution emerging in a large
two-dimensional disc that is stretched in the $y$ direction.
The stress distributions (in polar coordinates) obtained in that test case are visualized in the figure
below, the instructions to run OGS follow below the
figure...

## Option 1: Python {#python}

If you are familiar with Python and have a working Python installation at hand,
the recommended way to use a pre-built OGS is via Python.
Otherwise, maybe [Option 2](#binaries) might work for you.

1. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it (for more details see
   [here](/docs/userguide/basics/introduction/)).
2. Install the python package [OGSTools](https://ogstools.opengeosys.org):
   `pip install ogstools[ogs]`.
   It installs the [OpenGeoSys package](https://pypi.org/project/ogs/)
   for you and comes with our collection of Python pre- and post-processing
   tools and some selected packages that are commonly used together with OGS:
   [PyVista](https://pyvista.org/) for 3D visualization,
   [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),
   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
   and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), among others.
   After installing OGSTools, you will have a Python environment ready for the
   whole simulation workflow, from setting up simulation and mesh files to data
   analysis and creating publication-ready plots.
3. [Download](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/archive/master/ogs-master.zip?path=Tests/Data/Mechanics/Linear/DiscWithHole)
   the disc with hole example zip file from our GitLab server and unzip it.  
   The zip file contains (in the subdirectory
   `Tests/Data/Mechanics/Linear/DiscWithHole`)
   the [project file](/docs/userguide/basics/project_file_intro/),
   the simulation mesh,
   and a file defining the geometries on which boundary conditions are applied.
   Its contents can be viewed online [here](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/tree/master/Tests/Data/Mechanics/Linear/DiscWithHole).
4. [Download](/docs/benchmarks/small-deformations/linear_disc_with_hole/Linear_Disc_with_hole.ipynb)
   the Jupyter notebook underlying the
   [benchmark gallery page](/docs/benchmarks/small-deformations/linear_disc_with_hole)
   of this benchmark case.  
   Put the notebook in the same directory as the unzipped project file and mesh
   from step 3. This directory should contain the following files, now:
   * `disc_with_hole.gml`
   * `disc_with_hole.prj`
   * `disc_with_hole.vtu`
   * `Linear_Disc_with_hole.ipynb`
   * `Linear_Disc_with_hole.py`
5. Install [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) to run the notebook later on: `pip install jupyterlab`.  
   Remember: the Python virtual environment from step 1 must still be
   activated.
6. Open the notebook from step 4 in JupyterLab.  
   The notebook already contains plots of the analytical solution to the
   problem and of OGS simulation results.
   You can play around with it, now.
   A good first step is to rerun the entire notebook (*Restart Kernel and Run
   All Cells...*, see figure below).
   This will run OGS â€“ your first OGS run!

## Option 2: OGS binaries {#binaries}

**That only works on Windows**, because we offer prebuilt binaries of OGS for
Windows only. Users of Linux or Mac can use
[Singularity/Apptainer/Docker images](/docs/userguide/basics/container/) of
OGS.

1. Download the OGS binaries from our [release page](/releases#current).
   ![Download the current windows binaries of OGS](./releases-download-windows.png)
2. [Download](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/archive/master/ogs-master.zip?path=Tests/Data/Mechanics/Linear/DiscWithHole)
   the disc with hole example zip file from our GitLab server and unzip it.  
   The zip file contains (in the subdirectory
   `Tests/Data/Mechanics/Linear/DiscWithHole`)
   the [project file](/docs/userguide/basics/project_file_intro/),
   the simulation mesh,
   and a file defining the geometries on which boundary conditions are applied.
   Its contents can be viewed online [here](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/tree/master/Tests/Data/Mechanics/Linear/DiscWithHole).
3. Run OGS:  
   ![Run OGS in the terminal on Windows](windows-run-ogs.svg)
4. View the written output files (`*.pvd`, `*.vtu`), e.g., with [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/).

## Next steps

Now that you've succeeded with your first OGS run you
can dive deeper into OGS and, e.g., adapt the simulation model using
our user guide and [tutorials](/docs/tutorials).
