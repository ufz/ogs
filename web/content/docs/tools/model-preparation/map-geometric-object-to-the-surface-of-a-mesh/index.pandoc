## General

The tool ```MapGeometryToMeshSurface``` adjusts the z-coordinates of geometric points from a given geometry file ```my_geometry.gml``` such that they are located on the surface of a given mesh ```my_mesh.vtu``` and returns an updated geometry file ```my_mapped_geometry.gml```.

*MW: does the tool add points if necessary?*

*MW: what happens, if the geometry is spreading above the boundary of the mesh or not even close to the mesh?*

## Usage

```
MapGeometryToMeshSurface -m [my_mesh.vtu] -i [my_geometry.gml] -o [my_mapped_geometry.gml]
```

## Simple application example

Often, the mesh resolution and the resolution of the geometric objects like polylines are different.

*MW: so, what happens then?*

In the first figure such a situation is depicted. In the second figure the result of the application of the algorithm is shown.	

Usage for the example:
```
MapGeometryToMeshSurface -m SubsurfaceMesh.vtu -i TestPolyline.gml -o TestMappedPolyline.gml
```
