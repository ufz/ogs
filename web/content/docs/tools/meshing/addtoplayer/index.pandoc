## Introduction

The tool `AddTopLayer` adds one layer of elements with a specified thickness `thickness` on top of an existing mesh `input-mesh` and returns the newly generated mesh `output-mesh` that has an new top layer.

One might want to take care that the material groups are reduced, eg. material groups should not be [0,2,5], but [0,1,2]. The new layer will have the material group number of the highest material group +1.

The tool requires the [OGS-6 node ordering](http://doxygen.opengeosys.org/index.html) in the elements. A different node ordering may lead to unexpected results. In case one might try to change the ordering using the tool `NodeReordering`.

The tool is part of the official [OpenGeoSys git repository](https://github.com/ufz/ogs).

## Usage

```bash
AddTopLayer -i <input-mesh> -o <output-mesh> [-t <thickness>]
```

## Simple example

![](./SimpleQuadExampleWithNewTopLayer_1.png){ width=49% }
*Left*: A simple cube mesh with one material group (red). *Right*: The updated mesh where an additional layer (blue) was added on top of the domain with a second material group.

Usage for example:
```
AddTopLayer -i quad.vtu -o quad_with_new_top_layer.vtu -t 1
```

## Application

The tool was used to add a "soil" layer to the hydro-geological model of the Unstrut catchment within the INFLUINS project:
