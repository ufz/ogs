The [DECOVALEX](https://decovalex.org) project is an international research collaboration and model comparison initiative, established in 1992, aimed at advancing the understanding and modelling of coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in geological systems. The current project (2024-2027) is now in its ninth phase and we want to introduce a new framework for online benchmarking and model comparison. The first examples have been implemented in the [SAFENET](https://decovalex.org/D-2027/safenet2) and [ANALOG](https://decovalex.org/D-2027/analog) tasks.
