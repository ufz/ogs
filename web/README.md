## The big picture

- Development related content such as developer guide, benchmark documentation, tools description, ... will be simple Markdown files in e.g. [/web/content/docs](https://github.com/bilke/ogs/blob/web-hugo/web/content/docs/benchmarks/elliptic/groundwater-flow-neumann.md)
- You can preview documentation locally with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) – a static site generator
- You can [mark](https://github.com/bilke/ogs/blob/web-hugo/ProcessLib/GroundwaterFlow/CMakeLists.txt#L80) benchmarks to be automatically and interactively visualized [in the documentation](https://github.com/bilke/ogs/commit/d4fc7d94a3821a6b4483a1d7aeaabd6ee391c449#diff-2f5b1ac2a759aa09b2d3f5cc1ece45ceR108) inside your [browser](https://dev.opengeosys.org/docs/benchmarks/elliptic/groundwater-flow-neumann/#results-and-evaluation) via [vtk.js](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/)! 🍻 CURRENTLY DISABLED!

## Requirements

- Download [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/#action) and put it in your `PATH`
- [Install Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)

## Getting started

- Inside the source-directory `ogs/web`:
  - Run `hugo server`
  - Open http://localhost:1313

As you make modifications to the site it will be rebuild and the page in the browser gets reloaded.

## How-Tos

### Create a new page

By using `hugo new` you can create a new page with the correct frontmatter for that kind of page:

```bash
hugo new docs/benchmarks/elliptic/groundwater-flow-dirichlet.pandoc
```

- path is relative to `content/` and determines the URL of the page

Or you can simply create a new `.pandoc`-file in the correct location and fill it by yourself.

### Setup navigation for a page

The are submenus (shown in the left sidebar) for specific sections such as for benchmarks. The submenus consist of groups (e.g. *Elliptic*) and page entries. Groups are defined in `config.toml`:

```toml
[[menu.benchmarks]]
  name = "Elliptic"
  identifier = "elliptic"
  weight = 1
```

To add your page to a group as an entry add the following frontmatter:

```toml
weight = 101

[menu]
  [menu.benchmarks]
    parent = "elliptic"
```

`weight` specifies the order of groups and pages in ascending order (top -> down).

### Write a page

We use [Pandoc Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) for the actual content.

It is an enhanced version of the [original Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Please consult both guides!

#### Images

Use regular Markdown syntax:

```md
![](../square_1e2_neumann_gradients.png)
```

The path to the image can be absolute (by preceding with `/`) or relative. The relative path starts at your current URL. If your image is in the same directory as your `.pandoc`-file you have to prefix your path with `../` as in the example above.

See the [Pandoc Help](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#images) for more options on e.g. image size and captions.

#### Visualizations

CURRENTLY DISABLED!

Use shortcode `vis`:

```go
{{< vis path="Elliptic/square_1x1_GroundWaterFlow/square_1e2_pcs_0_ts_1_t_1.000000.vtu" [height="300"] >}}
```

`path` is relative to `ogs/web/static/vis/` and points to a converted data set, see below.

Optional parameters:

- `height` - In px

----

You can convert VTK output files to vtk.js format with:

```bash
npm run convert -- -e -i vtk-file.vtu -o output/path
```

Run `npm run convert` to get a list of possible arguments.

#### Equations

Equations can be set with typical LaTeX syntax by using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). Blocks are defined by `$$` at the beginning and `$$` at the end of the block. Inline math uses one `$` as the delimiter. For more usage instructions see the [MathJax LaTeX help](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html).

#### Files and Downloads

Files belonging directly to a page (e.g. images shown on that same page) should be added directly (they are stored by git lfs). Other stuff such as linked PDF files, book chapter input files should be uploaded elsewhere and linked to. You can ask @bilke to host these files for you (on Azure cloud storage).

#### Bibliography references

Bibliography items from *Documentation/bibliography.bib* can be referenced by their id with the `bib`-shortcode:

```go
{{< bib id="Kolditz2012" >}}
```

The bib-file has to be converted into a json-file with the [pandoc-citeproc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc)-tool:

```sh
[cd to ogs/web]
pandoc-citeproc --bib2json ../Documentation/bibliography.bib > data/bibliography.json
```

This json-file is then used by the shortcode.

## Advanced topics

### Optional requirements

- Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install); for downloading required JavaScript & CSS development packages
- Install [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/download/); for converting VTK output files to vtk.js-format for interactive web visualization, check if `pvpython` is either in the `PATH` or ParaView is installed in `/Applications/` on macOS or `/usr/local/opt/paraview` on Linux. CURRENTLY DISABLED!

### CSS & JavaScript development

- Inside the source-directory `ogs/web`:
  - Install packages with `yarn`
    - Re-run CMake and build the `ctest`-target, *OPTIONAL* for benchmark visualizations
  - Run `npm run build` to build the site which is created in `public/`
