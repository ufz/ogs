============

[OpenGeoSys][ogs] (OGS) is a scientific open source project for the development of
numerical methods for the simulation of thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical
(THMC) processes in porous and fractured media. OGS is implemented in C++, it
is object-oriented with an focus on the numerical solution of coupled multi-field
problems (multi-physics). Parallel versions of OGS are available relying on
both MPI and OpenMP concepts. Application areas of OGS are currently CO2
sequestration, geothermal energy, water resources management, hydrology and 
waste deposition. OGS is comprised of the THMC-simulator (simply referred to as
*OGS*) and a visualization tool (*Data Explorer*). OGS is developed by the
[OpenGeoSys Community][ogs].
