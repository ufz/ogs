 * \brief Manages the import and export of Aquaveo GMS files into and out of
 * GeoLib.
 *
 * This class currently supports reading and writing ASCII borehole files as
 * well as (partially) reading mesh files. The 3dm-mesh-file-reader is based on
 * example meshes and does currently only support the following element types:
 * E4T (tetrahedra), E4P/E5P (pyramids) and E6W (wedges/prisms). Not supported
 * are E8H (Hex), E4Q (Quad), E3T (Tri) as well as higher order elements. Please
 * refer to the file format documentation of GMS for details.
