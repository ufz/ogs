/**
 * \brief Filter class for assigning a texture to a surface.
 *
 * Use SetRaster() to define the texture that should be mapped on the object.
 * The input of this class is a vtkPolyData object. It is important to call SetTexture() before
 * calling SetInputConnection(). Texture coordinates will then be calculated automatically and
 * the texture will also be saved in the VtkAlgorithmProperties object from which this class is
 * derived (i.e. the texture can be returned by VtkAlgorithmProperties::GetTexture()).
 *
 * For convenience this class also has a converter function ConvertImageToTexture() which uses
 * a QImage as input.
